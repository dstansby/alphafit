This repository contains the code used to create the Helios 'corefit' dataset.

The code is split into two folders, each with it's own README file

- **fitting**: all the code used to generate the data set from original
distribution source files
- **visualising**: scripts used to visualise the new data set and compare it
to the old merged data set

### Acknowledgements
The code was written by myself (David Stansby). The majority of it was written
during a 2 week visit to UC Berkeley (USA) hosted by Chadi Salem. Thanks to
Chadi Salem, Tim Horbury, and Lorenzo Matteini for useful discussions and
advice concerning distribution functions and the Helios mission.
