This repository contains the code used to create the Helios 'alphafit' dataset.

The code is split into three folders, each with it's own README file

- **fitting**: all the code used to generate the data set from original
distribution source files
- **visualising**: scripts used to visualise the data
- **guide**: contains a user's guide to the data set


# Re-creating the dataset

Downloading and installing software
-----------------------------------
1. Download a copy of this repository
2. Install [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)
3. Create a new environment from the provided environment file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Configuring data output
-----------------------
In the `alphafit` directory, change the name of
`config.ini.template` to `config.ini` and fill in the directory where you
would like the output data to be saved to

Downloading original data files
-------------------------------
1. Create a directory to store all of the original magnetic field and
distribution function data files.
2. Configure heliopy to look in this location for the data files. Create
a heliopyrc file using
```bash
mkdir ~/.heliopy
echo "download_dir = /data/storage/directory" >> ~/.heliopy/heliopyrc
```
(replacing "/data/storage/directory" by the directory where all the data will
be stored)

3. Download the original distribution function files from ftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/helios-data/E1_experiment/helios_original/

The directory structure in your download location needs changing a bit,
and should look like (1974 is an example year, 44 is an example day of year)
```bash
/data/storage/directory/helios/helios1/dist/1974/44/...
```
If you only want to regenerate specific days of data, you only need to download
the relevant files and not the entire dataset.

Regenerating the alphafit dataset
--------------------------------
The alphafit data set can now be re-generated by changing to the
`alphafit` directory and running

```bash
python fitting/save_alpha_params.py
```

This will generate the data set in *.csv* files.
