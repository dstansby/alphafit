This repository contains the code used to create the Helios 'corefit' dataset.

The code is split into three folders, each with it's own README file

- **fitting**: all the code used to generate the data set from original
distribution source files
- **visualising**: scripts used to visualise the new data set and compare it
to the old merged data set
- **guide**: contains a user's guide to the data set

### Acknowledgements
The code was written by myself ([David Stansby](https://davidstansby.com)). I am supported by STFC studentship number ST/N504336/1.

The majority of it was written during a visit to UC Berkeley (USA) hosted by Chadi Salem.
Thanks to Chadi Salem, Tim Horbury, and Lorenzo Matteini for useful discussions and
advice concerning distribution functions and the Helios mission.
