This repository contains the code used to create the Helios 'alphafit' dataset.

The code is split into three folders, each with it's own README file

- **fitting**: all the code used to generate the data set from original
distribution source files
- **visualising**: scripts used to visualise the data
- **guide**: contains a user's guide to the data set
