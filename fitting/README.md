This folder contains the code that generates the corefit dataset from the
original distribution function files.

The following steps can be used to download the code, original data files, and
required dependencies:

1. Download a copy of this repository
2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/)
3. Install the required python dependencies by running
`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the `corefit` directory
4. Configure heliopy
5. Download the original distribution function files from ftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/helios-data/E1_experiment/helios_raw/
6. In the `corefit/fitting` directory, change the name of
`config.ini.template` to `config.ini` and fill in the directory where you
would like the output data to be saved to

The corefit data set can now be re-generated by changing to the
`corefit/fitting` directory and running

```bash
python save_dist_params.py
```

This will generate the data set in hdf files, which are easily read by python.
To clean and convert the files to ascii .csv files run

```bash
python convert_distparams.py
```
